|https://github.com/codeSTACKr/codeSTACKr/blob/master/README.md|Liked the concept of using _Vercel app api_ to create a live running instance of spotify music app. I have used the same on myPassion Readme markdown file including social media connectors with logo.<BR/>|
|https://github.com/matyo91/matyo91/blob/main/README.md|Liked the idea of using _Codesandbox_ to create a typewriter effect of text with animated background. I have copied the source code and configured it in the way I want for my Other_Service_Analysis_ markdown Assignment.<BR/>|
|https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats/blob/master/readme.md|**One of the best ReadMe among all the above shared links** , as I have personally liked his presentation skills. Creator used readme stats and links to showcase his skills via attaching it to colourful badges, also I have followed his way of accessing the statistics of Github account and applied it on my Self_Service_Analysis.<BR/>I have learned to build tags through website (Shields.io) and applied the same on my Other_Service_Analysis Assignment.|
